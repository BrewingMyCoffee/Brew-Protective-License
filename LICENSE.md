# 0. Foreword

This license is a free and open license which is intended as a mix between multiple licenses, protecting creators, preventing theft, whilst protecting fundamental liberties of the user. While it does not follow some traditionally Free and Open Source (Henceforth referred to as FOSS) ideals, it still will maintain some basic core ideas of the movement.

We believe traditional FOSS licenses allow companies or other individuals to abuse the open-ness of these licenses to harm the creators of software for their own gains.
It is meant as an alternative to something such as the GNU GPL, with more clauses regarding things such as competition and credit.

In short, you may modify the source or redistribute, as long as credit is given to the original author. You may fork the software as long as the fork is open source. Your software must be different enough to be noticably different than the original.
