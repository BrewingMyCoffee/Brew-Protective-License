# 0. Foreword

This license is a free and open license which is intended as a mix between multiple licenses, protecting creators, preventing theft, whilst protecting fundamental liberties of the user. While it does not follow some traditionally Free and Open Source (Henceforth referred to as FOSS) ideals, it still will maintain some basic core ideas of the movement.

We believe traditional FOSS licenses allow companies or other individuals to abuse the open-ness of these licenses to harm the creators of software for their own gains.

It is meant as an alternative to something such as the GNU GPL, with more clauses regarding things such as competition and credit.
